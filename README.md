# PSL-Data-Analysis
In this repo I have analyzed the Pakistan Super League data which is a cricket League and held every year. The first season was held in 2016
IT has 6 Teams 'ISLAMABAD UNITED', 'KARACHI KINGS', 'PESHAWAR ZALMI', 'QUETTA GLADIATORS', 'LAHORE QALANDARS', 'QUETTA GLADIATORS', 'MULTAN SULTANS'

## Features:
The dataset is of 127 matches 

- Team_1              127 non-null object
- Team_2              127 non-null object
- Team1_Code          127 non-null object
- Team2_Code          127 non-null object
- Season              127 non-null int64
- venue               127 non-null object
- id                  127 non-null int64
- Win_By_Wkts         127 non-null int64
- Win_By_Runs         127 non-null int64
- toss_winner         127 non-null object
- toss_winner_code    127 non-null object
- toss_decision       127 non-null object
- result              127 non-null object
- winner              127 non-null object
- winner_code         127 non-null object

## Findings:
I have answered some of the following questions

- Which team has won the most matches?
- Is there any game which did not complete?
- Is there a relationship between winning toss and winning match? if yes or no how many times has this happend that the winning team has also won the match
- It is a common misconception that the next to bat team has advantage to win the game due to the due factor and wetting of the ball. Is it True? What percentage of the team betting next wins the game too.
- Can you tell who was the winner of each season based on the data?

## Suggestions:
This is the practice data set and I felt more comfortable in exploring it then making model out of it becuase it doesnot contain the runs or wickets of each team at the end of the innings also there is lack of the numerical data as well
so in my opinion it is naive to make predictor of this dataset.
For your practice though, I am not limiting you guys. feel free to explore the data and make the model out of it.
